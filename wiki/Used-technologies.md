# Back end  
## Introduction  
The project will be a display of designing and implementing a loosely coupled architecture (microservices). So for each microservice based on the technological needs the following tools will be used:  
* Python - ETL, model development
** FastAPI - http framework for exposing the inference models
** Pytorch - continuous training and data validation for the inference models  
* Go - first-class support of concurrency, robust and minimal
** Fiber - http framework
** RabbitMQ - messaging broker
# Data storage    
* Azure or AWS Data Lake  
* SQL database/Redis for external user information
